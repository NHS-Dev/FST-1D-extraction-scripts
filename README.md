# 1D extration scripts for Environment Canada FST files. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Overview**

These scripts extract a one-dimensional data point from Envrionment Canada's standard format files (FST). There is the functionality to input a set of desired coordinates (longtitude, latitude, x or y), or to query coordinates based on a set of attributes and landcover indicies from geophysical input fields. Once a set of coordinates are selected,  data is queried from *.fst* files containing model outputs.  Currently, the only method of exporting data is into *.txt* files.
